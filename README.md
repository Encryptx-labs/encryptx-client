## **Overview**  
The Encryptix Protocol is an innovative event ticketing platform leveraging blockchain technology to bring transparency, security, and user empowerment. By eliminating intermediaries and introducing smart wallet functionality, Encryptix simplifies ticket issuance, transfer, and resale.

This documentation provides a deep dive into the architecture, technical components, and implementation details to help developers and stakeholders understand the protocol thoroughly.

---

## **Features**  
- **Decentralized Ticketing**: Complete transparency in ticket creation, sales, and resales.  
- **Smart Wallets**: Users interact seamlessly with blockchain through smart wallets powered by OnChainKit.  
- **Paymaster Integration**: Gasless transactions with OnChainKit paymaster capabilities.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built on **Next.js** for a smooth and intuitive frontend experience.  
- **Secure Transactions**: Leveraging blockchain immutability to prevent fraud and forgery.  

---

## **Architecture**  

### **High-Level Architecture**  
The Encryptix Protocol architecture consists of three major components:  
1. **Frontend (Next.js)**:  
   - Provides a seamless user experience for event organizers and attendees.  
   - Includes features for ticket creation, transfer, and resale.  

2. **Smart Contracts**:  
   - Powers the core functionality of ticket management, ownership transfers, and resale royalties.  
   - Built with **Solidity**, leveraging ERC-721 for unique ticket representation.  

3. **OnChainKit Integration**:  
   - **Smart Wallet**: Offers a secure, user-friendly wallet solution for storing and managing tickets.  
   - **Paymaster**: Enables gasless transactions by sponsoring gas fees for users.  

---

### **Detailed Architecture Flow**  
Below is an overview of the workflow:  

1. **Ticket Issuance**:  
   - Event organizers deploy an ERC-721 smart contract to mint unique tickets.  
   - Metadata includes event details, seat number, and royalty terms for resales.

2. **Smart Wallet Creation**:  
   - Users automatically receive a smart wallet powered by **OnChainKit** upon platform sign-up.  
   - Wallets are fully non-custodial, ensuring user control.  

3. **Transaction Management (Gasless)**:  
   - Users interact with the protocol without worrying about gas fees.  
   - The **OnChainKit Paymaster** sponsors transaction fees, offering a frictionless experience.  

4. **Secondary Market**:  
   - Tickets can be resold securely within the platform.  
   - Royalties for organizers and creators are automated via smart contracts.
